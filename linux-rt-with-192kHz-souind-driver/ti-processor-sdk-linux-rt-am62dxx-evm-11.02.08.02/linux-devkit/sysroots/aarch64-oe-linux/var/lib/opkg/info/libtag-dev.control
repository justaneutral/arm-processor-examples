Package: libtag-dev
Version: 2.0.1-r0.63
Description: Library for reading and editing the meta-data of popular audio formats - Development files
 Platform-independent library (tested on Windows/Linux) for reading and
 writing metadata in media files, including video, audio, and photo
 formats. This is a convenient one-stop-shop to present or tag all your
 media collection, regardless of which format/container these might use.
 You can read/write the standard or more common tags/properties of a
 media, or you can also create and retrieve your own custom tags.  This
 package contains symbolic links, header files, and related items
 necessary for software development.
