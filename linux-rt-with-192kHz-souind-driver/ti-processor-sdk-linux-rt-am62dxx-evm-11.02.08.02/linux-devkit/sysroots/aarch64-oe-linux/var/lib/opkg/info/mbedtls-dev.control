Package: mbedtls-dev
Version: 3.6.5-r0.2
Description: Lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library - Development files
 mbedtls is a lean open source crypto library          for providing SSL
 and TLS support in your programs. It offers        an intuitive API and
 documented header files, so you can actually    understand what the code
 does. It features:
 - Symmetric algorithms, like AES, Blowfish, Triple-DES, DES, ARC4,
 Camellia and XTEA                                                  - Hash
 algorithms, like SHA-1, SHA-2, RIPEMD-160 and MD5             - Entropy
 pool and random generators, like CTR-DRBG and HMAC-DRBG    - Public key
 algorithms, like RSA, Elliptic Curves, Diffie-Hellman,    ECDSA and ECDH
 - SSL v3 and TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2                                    -
 Abstraction layers for ciphers, hashes, public key operations,
 platform abstraction and threading                                  This
 package contains symbolic links, header files, and related items
 necessary for software development.
