Description: Framework for layout and rendering of internationalized text - Development files
 Pango is a library for laying out and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed, though most of the work on Pango so far has been done in the
 context of the GTK+ widget toolkit. Pango forms the core of text and font
 handling for GTK+-2.x.  This package contains symbolic links, header
 files, and related items necessary for software development.
