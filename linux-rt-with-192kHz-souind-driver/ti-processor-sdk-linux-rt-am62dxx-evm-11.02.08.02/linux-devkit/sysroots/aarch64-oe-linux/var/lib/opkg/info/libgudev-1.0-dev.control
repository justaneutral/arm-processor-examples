Package: libgudev-1.0-dev
Version: 238-r0.426
Description: GObject wrapper for libudev - Development files
 This library makes it much simpler to use libudev from programs already
 using GObject. It also makes it possible to easily use libudev from other
 programming languages, such as Javascript, because of GObject
 introspection support.  This package contains symbolic links, header
 files, and related items necessary for software development.
