Package: libell-dev
Version: 0.64-r0.402
Description: Embedded Linux Library - Development files
 The Embedded Linux Library (ELL) provides core, low-level functionality
 for system daemons. It typically has no dependencies other than the Linux
 kernel, C standard library, and libdl (for dynamic linking). While ELL is
 designed to be efficient and compact enough for use on embedded Linux
 platforms, it is not limited to resource-constrained systems.  This
 package contains symbolic links, header files, and related items
 necessary for software development.
