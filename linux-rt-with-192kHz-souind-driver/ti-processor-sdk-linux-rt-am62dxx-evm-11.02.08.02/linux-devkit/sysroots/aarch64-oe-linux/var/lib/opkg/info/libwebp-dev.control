Package: libwebp-dev
Version: 1.3.2-r0.65
Description: WebP is an image format designed for the Web - Development files
 WebP is a method of lossy and lossless compression that can be
 used on a large variety of photographic, translucent and
 graphical images found on the web. The degree of lossy
 compression is adjustable so a user can choose the trade-off
 between file size and image quality. WebP typically achieves
 an average of 30% more compression than JPEG and JPEG 2000,
 without loss of image quality.  This package contains symbolic links,
 header files, and related items necessary for software development.
