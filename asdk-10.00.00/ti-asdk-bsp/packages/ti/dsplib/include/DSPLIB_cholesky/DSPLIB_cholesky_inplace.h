 * @brief    Kernel for computing Inplace Cholesky Decomposition
 * @details
 *          - This kernel decomposes the input square matrix \f$A\f$ into a 
 *            upper triangular matrix \f$U\f$ where:
 *          \f{eqnarray*}{
 *               A = U^{T} \times U
 *          \f}
 *          - Processing is done inplace of the \f$A\f$ matrix i.e. the upper triangular entries of 
 *            \f$A\f$ matrix represent output \f$U\f$ matrix.
 *          - This kernel provide fuctionality for checking of symmetric positive definiteness of
 *            input matrix \f$A\f$. Check @ref DSPLIB_cholesky_inplace_InitArgs.enableTest
